download = go mod download -json
    matches what is downloaded

gomodcache = $GOMODCACHE/cache/download/**/*.zip
    matches what is downloaded (obviously)

vendor_with_unused = vendor/modules.txt, drop wildcard replacements
    matches what would be downloaded, superset of what is vendored

vendor = vendor/modules.txt, drop wildcard replacements and modules that don't have packages
    matches what is vendored

listdeps_all = go list -deps -json all
    subset of vendor

listdeps_threedot = go list -deps -json ./...
    subset of listdeps_all



if there are no local replacements:
    download == gomodcache == vendor_with_unused >= vendor >= listdeps_all >= listdeps_threedot

local replacements do not appear in download or gomodcache (do appear in the others)
